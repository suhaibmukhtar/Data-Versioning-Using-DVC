# Data-Versioning-Using-DVC
This repository will contain the hands-on practice on how to track the versions of the source-code. This repository will further track the data and artifacts of each component of the ML-Pipeline using DVC. To track each version of the data related to source code, DVC is used in parallel with the Git.
